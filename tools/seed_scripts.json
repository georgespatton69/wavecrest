I was in that world. Prison riots, street mentality, constant fight-or-flight.\nMy nervous system was trained to stay on edge.\nAnd then I got sober\u2026 and I had to face something harder than fights: silence. Feelings. Regret. Responsibility.\nSobriety wasn\u2019t soft for me. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\nCONTRAST (45\u201365s):\n\u201cToday my life is calm. I wake up clear. I\u2019m consistent. I show up. I help other people.\nThe old me wouldn\u2019t recognize this peace.\u201d\nCTA (65\u201375s):\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re too far gone, I want you to hear me: you\u2019re not.
